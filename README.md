# NFTMarketPlace

### This project involves creating an ERC721 compliant token that implements all ERC721 functions. The NFT token contract allows users to create Krypto Kitties as well as breed new Krypto kittie offspring from combining the DNA of 2 parents. The Marketplace allows users to buy & sell their NFT Krypto Kitties as well as remove their offers on the marketplace. Truffle was used to deploy contracts to the Rinkeby network and photos below show the contract addresses of both the Kitty Contract and MarketPlace Contract.
